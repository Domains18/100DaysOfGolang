## Distributed Key-Value Store (a la etcd)


### Core Components and Architecture

1. **Nodes and Clustering**
   - Set up the store to operate in a cluster of nodes. Each node is a separate instance that can communicate with others.
   - Implement a **node discovery** mechanism so nodes can locate each other when they join the cluster, either by static configuration or service discovery.

2. **Raft Consensus Algorithm**
   - Implement Raft to handle **leader election**, **log replication**, and **synchronization** across nodes.
   - The leader node will handle write requests, replicating changes to follower nodes. This leader’s role ensures **strong consistency** across the cluster.
   - Raft provides safety guarantees by enforcing **log consistency** across nodes, allowing each entry in a distributed log to be applied in order across all nodes.

3. **Key-Value Storage with Replication**
   - Each node will have a local storage (in-memory or persistent) to store key-value pairs.
   - The leader node will manage all write operations and replicate updates to followers, ensuring data consistency.
   - Use **snapshots** to periodically persist the state of each node and **log compaction** to free up memory by cleaning out old, unnecessary logs.

4. **Consistency and Partition Tolerance**
   - Handle network partitions with mechanisms to promote partition tolerance. Use Raft’s **commit index** and **term-based leader election** to maintain consistency when nodes lose connectivity.
   - When a node rejoins, sync it with the cluster’s current state by using Raft logs or snapshots.

5. **gRPC for Communication**
   - Use gRPC to define and handle node communication (e.g., leader election, heartbeat, replication).
   - Define gRPC services for requests like `PUT`, `GET`, `DELETE`, and other metadata operations (like `JoinCluster`, `LeaveCluster`).

6. **Transactions (Optional)**
   - Add support for lightweight transactions by allowing conditional operations, like `PUT_IF_ABSENT` or `COMPARE_AND_SET`.
   - Support multi-key transactions, if desired, using a two-phase commit protocol or similar strategy for consistency.

### Additional Features to Consider

- **Failure Detection and Heartbeat Mechanism**: Implement a heartbeat mechanism for detecting node failures. If a node fails, a new leader election will occur.
- **Quorum-Based Reads and Writes**: To balance availability and consistency, implement quorum reads/writes, where only a majority of nodes need to agree on a read/write operation.
- **Snapshot Management**: Take snapshots of the data state to optimize recovery and reduce memory usage.
- **Monitoring and Metrics**: Integrate observability with metrics (latency, replication time) and logging for cluster health, which is crucial for troubleshooting.
  
### Example Flow: Writing Data

1. **Client Sends a Write Request to the Leader**
   - The leader appends the entry to its log and sends replication requests to followers.
   
2. **Replication and Consensus**
   - The leader waits for a majority of followers to acknowledge the write before committing it.
   - Followers apply the change to their local storage after the log entry is committed.
   
3. **Response to Client**
   - Once the leader commits the write, it sends an acknowledgment to the client. If the leader fails mid-write, the new leader takes over based on the current logs.

This setup balances **strong consistency** (thanks to Raft), **availability** during node failures, and **partition tolerance**. It’s a great way to dive deep into distributed systems design and Go’s concurrency strengths. Let me know if you want to explore specific implementation details!
